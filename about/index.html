  <p>Jourdan Trudeau is a writer, a teacher, and a semi-professional dreamer. She grew up in the beautiful city of Beaverton, Oregon, within ideal proximity to Powell’s Books. As a child she consumed books at a rate that would impress a Competitive Eater. She received a B.A. in English with a Minor in Creative Writing from Oregon State University. She has had the wonderful opportunity to work at many interesting places, including but not limited to, a local dog wash, The Oregon Zoo as a ZooTeen Volunteer, The Daily Barometer (OSU’s Daily Student Newspaper) as a Writer, The Oregon State Arthropod Collection as a Curator, Freshwater News as a Journalist, Unruly Guides as a Writer and Editor, and currently as a Tutor and Teacher at Tualatin Valley Academy. She is excited for wherever this life takes her next.</p>

<p>Most importantly Jourdan has felt blessed to have the support and guidance of friends and family. Without them she would be lost. So thank you.</p>
