Jourdan Trudeau is a writer, a teacher, and a semi-professional dreamer. She grew up in the beautiful city of Beaverton, Oregon, within ideal proximity to Powell’s Books. As a child she consumed books at a rate that would impress a Competitive Eater. She received a B.A. in English with a Minor in Creative Writing from Oregon State University. She has had the wonderful opportunity to work at many interesting places, including but not limited to, a local dog wash, The Oregon Zoo as a ZooTeen Volunteer, The Daily Barometer (OSU’s Daily Student Newspaper) as a Writer, The Oregon State Arthropod Collection as a Curator, Freshwater News as a Journalist, Unruly Guides as a Writer and Editor, and currently as a Tutor and Teacher at Tualatin Valley Academy. She is excited for wherever this life takes her next.

Most importantly Jourdan has felt blessed to have the support and guidance of friends and family. Without them she would be lost. So thank you.
