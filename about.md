Jourdan Trudeau is a writer, a teacher, and a semi-professional dreamer. She grew up in the beautiful city of Beaverton, Oregon, within ideal proximity to Powell’s Books. As a child she consumed books at a rate that would impress a Competitive Eater. She received a B.A. in English with a Minor in Creative Writing from Oregon State University. She is currently pursuing an MAT from Pacific University. 

She has had the wonderful opportunity to work at many interesting places, including, a local dog wash, The Oregon Zoo, The Daily Barometer (OSU’s Daily Student Newspaper), The Oregon State Arthropod Collection, Freshwater News, Unruly Guides (an online publisher), and at Tualatin Valley Academy as a substitute teacher and tutor. She is excited for wherever life takes her next.

Most importantly, Jourdan has felt blessed to have the support and guidance of friends and family. Without them she would be lost. So, thank you.
